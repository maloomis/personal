          <p>
            I peaked an interest in computer science my senior year of high
            school when I took a basic web development class. Since then my love
            for the field grew, and I went on to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in
            Information Science at Northeastern University. During my time
            there, I had several internships including a project management role
            at Boston Private Bank, a web development role at Collette, and
            finally as an application developer at Workday, where I decided to
            continue full time. Through all my experiences, one fact has held
            true. I love technology and the power it gives you to solve real
            world problems. I feel fulfilled knowing that in the technical
            industry, there is always something new to learn and someone to
            help.
