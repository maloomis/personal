          I peaked an interest in computer science my senior year of high school
          when I took a basic web development class. Since then my love for the
          field grew, and I went on to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Information
          Science at Northeastern University. During my time there, I had
          several internships including a project management role at Boston
          Private Bank, a web development role at Collette, and finally as an
          application developer at Workday, where I decided to continue full
          time. Through all my experiences, one fact has held true. I love
          technology and the power it gives you to solve real world problems. I
          feel fulfilled knowing that in the technical industry, there is always
          something new to learn and someone to help. Skills/Interests:
          Javascript, React, Angular, Node, Redux, CSS, HTML, Git, Mongo, SQL
